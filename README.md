## Requirements

Install the necessary libraries using this command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Using a virtual environment is strongly encouraged!

## Run the web app

> Assuming you use the PyCharm IDE.

Right-click on `run.py` and select `Run 'run'`. Your web app will now be accessible via `localhost:8080`.

Every time you'll change a Python file, your web app will auto-reload. But it won't auto-reload on non-Python files 
changes. In that case just make a minor edit (like adding a space) in some Python file to force auto-reload.

## Shut down the web app

To **shut down** the web app click the **red square icon** below the reload button.
